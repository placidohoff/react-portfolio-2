    `My name is Placido Hoff and I am a software and web developer.  I have always been fascinated with computer science and digital electronics but what I do best is software engineering. I was initially drawn to JavaScript after learning how to create HTML5 games. Today I am even more proficient writing code with my framework of choice being React.js to build websites and applications. I find it to be a very powerful and useful framework, but I am also familiar with other languages such as C#, Java, and TypeScript.`,

    `Currently I work construction under a master electrician doing electrical wiring. I also work as a vertical engineer/carpenter for the Rhode Island National Guard. Construction is something I chose to do in order to serve my country and community by helping those who have been displaced from their places of residence. After long reflection and evaluation, I have decided to change careers in order to not let my skills and creativity with coding go to waste. I have done freelance work, but I would like to do this full time as my profession`,

    `I was introduced to computer programming years before joining the Army National Guard and I showed that I have the aptitude and a great potential for doing it. I continue to improve to this day and beyond. Currently I am a student in the Nucamp coding bootcamp and I create full stack applications for fun for myself and others. I thoroughly enjoy planning out how to represent data as a model in a database then coding which controllers would fetch this data to be shown to the user and designing beautiful graphic user interfaces. I am constantly expanding my knowledge and techniques of development, and therefore I know I would be a productive asset to your company. I hope to talk or meet with you soon to talk to you about the projects I have created and how I intend to complete projects that will be assigned to me. Hope to hear from you soon, be well.
